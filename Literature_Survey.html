                      In literature survey we have focused on the same areas of similar research functionalities and parts. The main purpose of our project is to make a Blood Donation Application that is user friendly and has the intelligence to seek out the donations will no longer be a matter of risk and worries. At the beginning of the project we've researched on some secondary resources supported this. From these sources, we have been able to know the existing functions and determined our work outline.<br/>
    <br/>By inventing the <a href="https://tykn.tech/">Tykn’s digital identity platform</a> significantly suggests that the healthcare industry could easily and seamlessly verify digital Verifiable Credentials issued by other organizations. A healthcare facility could trust the authenticity of a patient credential without even having to check the actual data there contained. In identity management blockchain device these privacy maintaining channels would be assured through cryptography and Zero-Knowledge Proofs. If the signature matches the one in the patient’s credential, it’s authentic. Those findings may have been more applicable to LifeShare system Smart ID which make disconnected and duplicated patients information records, to widespread integration with a distributed master identity record as well as users are able to create an identity profile and allow access to only authorized users.<br/>
    <br/>By inventing the <a href="https://www.readme.lk/veins-blood-donor-app/">Veins Application</a>, Mr. Perera L significantly suggests that location-based app to find the nearest donor for a particular blood donation requirement. Developer Sachira Fernando (CEO of Inforgrid Holdings) and his team was the creators of this project.<br/> 

    <br/>And also there was a similar project done by "Dialog.lk" ensures instant location tracking and communication is important during an emergency. <a href="https://www.dialog.lk/about/responsibility/outreach-cr/network-of-life/dialog-nbts-sms-blood-7777-service/">Dialog SMS Blood</a> enables mobile users to register as blood donors through SMS. To register for this service, the user must type BLOOD and send to 7777 from his/ her Dialog Mobile. Upon registering they can access the services provided by the National Blood Transfusion Service using their Dialog mobile by dialing #770#, and even locate the nearest blood donation center and view their donation history.<br/> 

     <br/>Pacheco D concludes that this understanding was crucial because, from this pivotal research, he has developed successfully a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7930122">Characterizing Organ Donation Awareness from Social Media</a>. Approximately 22 people die every day in the USA due to a lack of organs for transplant. Their hypothesis is that social media can be utilized as a sensor to characterize organ donation awareness and population engagement in donation for each different organ. This paper aims at exploring the extent in which social media, such as Twitter, may be used to sense the population regarding organ donation awareness.<br/>

<br/>Xiaochu Y reveals that prediction of blood supply and demand in the next 20 years with population ageing in China according to the research <a href="https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/98/1/19-233361/en/">Population-based projections of blood supply and demand in China</a>. The aging of the general population in China will increase the demand for blood products, which may lead to severe disruption of blood supply and demand. This study aims to predict changes in blood supply and demand by 2035 in China[8]. This study would have been more useful if it had rare blood type prediction when compared to our LifeShare system. The various literatures reviewed in this section the proposed system provides a trustful system to any stakeholders to use especially, voluntary blood donors and organ donors to feel more confident when donating.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
