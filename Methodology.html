                    For Blockchain based component process system generates a smart identity card for donors and recipients after verified data accuracy. So, they can share their identity with main health organizations by linking their private key which can remains data non-identifiable to those without the key. The donor and recipient record can be seen as a global database, based on Blockchain technology, secured with cryptographic tools. Confidentiality and privacy can be achieved using the encryption tools and techniques.<br/> 
                    <br/> Smart Identity uses the Ethereum blockchain to represent an identity using a smart contract, attributes can be added by the identity owner and are stored in hash form. This is the Smart Identity contract as used by the Smart Identity instance. It describes the core functionality required as part of a Smart Identity contracts with encryption keys, attributes & endorsements. A Smart ID is an Ethereum Smart Contract address. The smart contract must be constructed using valid Smart ID bytecode. It provides access to identity management commands and stores hash representations of identity data. Smart ID enables disconnected and duplicated patients information records, to widespread integration with a distributed master identity record. Users are able to create an identity profile, and allow trusted users, including institutions, to verify its authenticity. Users can then interact between one another directly, safe in the knowledge that their counterparty is who they say they are.<br/><br/>

                      <i><b>B.  Automate the blood group matching with location tracking system</b></i><br/><br/>
                    According to auto matching part, a person willing to become a blood donor has to perform all the compulsory blood tests required before donating blood. Then user can get the medical eligibility details. After all he/she must register into the system. If the person is found to be an eligible donor,  personal details and the eligibility details will be fed into the system database of eligible donors by healthcare personnel. An email and notification will automatically be sent to the user. After that system will be able to track and locate the user whenever required. Healthcare personnel send a query using the web application to find donors of the required blood group. The query gives a list of all donors with the required blood group together with a notification for those donors who have their tracking option on. Actually, there are 2 lists. One is nearest donors with location. Other one is non-nearest donors. Location is tracked by GPS location service. To find the best matches among the donors available with the help of Machine Learning based decision tree. In this method, blood factors of the person who needs blood, will be compared with blood factors of all donors in database. This system is different than others because it uses Automation method for detecting the best matched donors. It has also the feature that if a person donates blood one time then he will be not shown in the map for next four months because it’s not healthy to donate blood more than once in four months. App will filter only those people who are eligible to donate blood according to age and last donated date. So the all tracking and automating methodologies are depend on databases. And not as an independent document. Please do not revise any of the current designations.<br/><br/>

                      The forecasted demand and price trends were visualized using line charts over a period of 12 months. The charts showed an increasing trend in demand and price over time, with occasional fluctuations.                    <br/><b>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

                            This research utilized historical data on Sri Lanka's coffee export quantity and price, along with other factors such as crude oil price, US dollar exchange rate, and coffee production, to forecast future demand and price for different coffee flavors. The dataset was collected from various sources, including the Sri Lanka export agriculture department, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Data preprocessing techniques such as cleaning, integration, transformation, and reduction were applied to improve data quality. Three machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest, Linear Regression, and Decision Tree, were employed for forecasting, with Random Forest being selected as the best-performing algorithm. Performance evaluation metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination were used. The forecasted trends were visualized using line charts, showing an overall increasing trend with occasional fluctuations.

                    As the interest in organ donation is relatively low, after developed this system helped to improve the attitude of people toward organ donation. This research seeks to identify the level of knowledge, attitude and commitment among people by updating special notices and news. System generates a list of donors separately who are eligible to donate each organ by using Machine learning with python. And also, daily organ prediction was done by using ML model using flask. It was able to introduce special features in this research part integrating to our platform. Other special feature was sharing the blood and organ request in social media or via SMS to spread the message through the society. By developing a questionnaire circulated to public with regard to have knowledge on organ donation for each solid organ and analyze answers of those questionnaires. The special notices and notifications send to users includes information, circulars and rules about donating blood and organs. Those functions were done by using Artificial intelligence.<br/> 
                    <br/> React JS technology has used to develop the User interfaces and Node JS, Java for back end parts. Visual Studio Code, Intellij and Sublime text are tools for React JS, Node JS and Java parts implementations. MySQL workbench and XAMPP used for database connection. Algorithms have created in python language, by using PyCharm. This community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 205 people living in different districts in Sri Lanka. By this system analyzes were carried out using pretested questionnaire, which included the details on organ donation for each solid organ. Data were entered into Excel and analyzed using Statistical Package.<br/><br/>
