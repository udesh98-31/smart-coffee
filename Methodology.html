                      This research aims to develop a smart platform using machine learning to predict the most suitable coffee variant and yield based on location in Sri Lanka. A dataset was collected, including location coordinates, weather data, main coffee varieties, and yield data from 2017 to 2022 in five selected coffee-growing districts. Linear regression is utilized for predictive modeling. The research seeks to answer questions about accurate agricultural predictions, main coffee variants, significant weather factors, and the accuracy of machine learning algorithms. Data collection involves literature review, consultation with coffee export department, and obtaining weather and yield data from reliable sources. Data analysis includes preprocessing, descriptive statistics, and machine learning modeling. Model evaluation metrics such as MSE, MAE, and RME are used. The results are interpreted, implications discussed, and recommendations made for coffee growers. The developed predictive models and application aim to assist growers in decision-making for optimal coffee cultivation. Privacy and confidentiality of data are ensured, with necessary permissions and informed consent obtained.                    </p>

                      <i><b>B.  Disease identification and diagnosis</b></i><br/><br/>
                      This subsystem was developed to identify diseases in coffee plants using image processing. The captured images could be uploaded to the system, which then accurately identified the diseases with a percentage of accuracy. The machine learning algorithm utilized in this system was a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which was trained on a dataset comprising various coffee diseases, including leaf rust disease, coffee berry disease, leaf miner disease, and others. This trained CNN model enabled the system to effectively diagnose and classify coffee plant diseases.In this system, several steps were involved in the disease detection process.
                      <br/>
                      Firstly, three types of coffee leaf diseases were selected, and more than 1000 images of healthy and diseased plants were used to train the model. Since the captured images could have different forms and dimensions, a preprocessing step was performed to bring them to a consistent size. Afterwards, the output image was transferred to the subsequent step of disease detection.
                      <br/>
                      Data augmentation was employed to enhance the performance of the dataset during training. This technique augmented the dataset by applying various transformations to the images, thereby increasing the diversity of the training samples. For this system, a CNN model was used, which was coupled with a SoftMax activation function in the output layer. Additionally, an initial layer was added to the model for resizing, normalizing, and data augmentation. This ensured that the images could be accurately classified into their respective diseases, resulting in more precise output.
                      <br/>
                      Prior to feeding the images into the neural network, resizing them to the desired size was necessary. Moreover, normalizing the pixel values of the images (within the range of 0 and 1) was crucial for improving the model's performance. This normalization process involved dividing the pixel values by 256. The resizing and normalization steps were performed during both training and inference stages. Hence, a layer implementing these operations was included in the Sequential Model.

                      The forecasted demand and price trends were visualized using line charts over a period of 12 months. The charts showed an increasing trend in demand and price over time, with occasional fluctuations.                    <br/>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

                            This research utilized historical data on Sri Lanka's coffee export quantity and price, along with other factors such as crude oil price, US dollar exchange rate, and coffee production, to forecast future demand and price for different coffee flavors. The dataset was collected from various sources, including the Sri Lanka export agriculture department, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Data preprocessing techniques such as cleaning, integration, transformation, and reduction were applied to improve data quality. Three machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest, Linear Regression, and Decision Tree, were employed for forecasting, with Random Forest being selected as the best-performing algorithm. Performance evaluation metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination were used. The forecasted trends were visualized using line charts, showing an overall increasing trend with occasional fluctuations.

                      Dataset Collection: The dataset used in this research was obtained from the Ministry of Export Agriculture Department. The department provided access to a comprehensive dataset containing soil data and corresponding coffee variety labels. The dataset was collected through their extensive monitoring and research efforts in the coffee production sector. It included information on soil pH, soil moisture, nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium levels, along with the corresponding coffee variety for each sample.
                      <br/>
                      
                      Data Preprocessing:To prepare the dataset for training the deep learning algorithm, several preprocessing steps were performed. The dataset was loaded using the pandas library in Python, and the input features and target variable were extracted from the dataset. The input features were standardized using the StandardScaler from the scikit-learn library to ensure they were on a similar scale. The target variable was encoded using LabelEncoder to convert the coffee variety labels into numeric values suitable for training the model. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets using the train test split function from scikit learn.
                      <br/>
                      Algorithm Selection:For training the coffee variety prediction model, a neural network with two hidden layers was selected as the deep learning algorithm. The model was implemented using the TensorFlow framework in Python. The neural network architecture consisted of three layers: a dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation function, a dense layer with 64 units and ReLU activation function, and a dense layer with the number of units equal to the number of unique coffee varieties in the dataset and softmax activation function. The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function.
                      <br/>
                      
                      Model Evaluation:The model was trained on the training set using the fit function in TensorFlow, with a validation split of 0.2 and a batch size of 64. The training process was performed for 1000 epochs. After training, the model was evaluated on the testing set to assess its performance. The test loss and test accuracy were calculated using the evaluate function in TensorFlow.
                      <br/>
                      Additional Functionality: In addition to training and evaluating the model, the code provided includes functionality for predicting the coffee variety based on input parameters from a text file. The function predict coffee variety takes the path to the pre-trained model and the path to the input file as inputs. It loads the model, reads the input parameters from the text file, standardizes the input features using the same scaler used during training, and predicts the coffee variety using the trained model. The predicted coffee variety is then returned as the output.
