                        While previous research has made significant contributions to the understanding of coffee cultivation, there are still several research gaps that present opportunities for further investigation. These research gaps can be categorized based on the different research components addressed in this study: coffee variety prediction, export demand and price forecasting, disease identification and diagnosis, and coffee variety and yield prediction based on location.<br/>

<br/>In terms of coffee variety prediction, past research has primarily focused on factors such as climate, altitude, and soil composition. However, there has been limited exploration of soil texture as a predictor of coffee variety. This study addresses this gap by incorporating soil texture as a key factor in coffee variety prediction, recognizing the importance of understanding the relationship between soil texture and coffee variety suitability.<br/>

<br/>Regarding export demand and price forecasting, previous studies have often focused on analyzing historical export quantity and price data. However, there has been a lack of comprehensive analysis considering the influence of supporting factors such as crude oil prices and exchange rates. This research aims to bridge this gap by considering a broader set of factors and their impact on export demand and price, providing a more accurate and holistic forecasting model.<br/>
<br/>In the area of disease identification and diagnosis, previous research has explored various methods, including visual inspection and manual identification of coffee plant diseases. However, there has been limited application of automated image processing techniques and convolutional neural networks for disease identification. This study introduces the use of image processing and convolutional neural networks to accurately diagnose and classify coffee plant diseases, offering a more efficient and precise approach.<br/>
<br/>Lastly, in the domain of coffee variety and yield prediction based on location, previous studies have examined the impact of weather conditions on coffee cultivation. However, there has been limited integration of location-specific factors, such as latitude, longitude, and local weather data. This research addresses this gap by considering location coordinates, weather data, and historical yield data to predict the most suitable coffee variety and yield based on specific locations in Sri Lanka.<br/>
<br/>The novelty of this research lies in its comprehensive and integrated approach to coffee cultivation. By incorporating soil texture in coffee variety prediction, considering a broader set of supporting factors for export demand and price forecasting, utilizing automated image processing for disease identification and diagnosis, and integrating location-specific factors for coffee variety and yield prediction, this study offers a unique and holistic perspective.<br/>

<br/>While this research aims to fill the identified research gaps, there is still room for further exploration and refinement in each research component. Future empirical studies and data collection specific to the Sri Lankan coffee industry will contribute to a deeper understanding of these research gaps and provide additional insights into coffee cultivation practices.<br/><br/>
