                        The research problem addressed in this study is the underutilization of information technology (IT) in coffee cultivation in Sri Lanka, and the associated difficulties faced by coffee farmers. Despite the potential for increased profitability in the global coffee market, many farmers in Sri Lanka continue to struggle due to limited access to accurate technology and support. This research aims to identify the specific challenges in coffee cultivation and propose solutions that leverage advanced IT techniques, including IoT devices, image processing, and machine learning algorithms, to overcome these challenges.<br/>   
                        The difficulties faced by coffee farmers in Sri Lanka include:
<br/><br/> <b><i>
• Lack of knowledge about the most suitable coffee variety: Coffee farmers struggle to determine the most appropriate coffee variety based on soil texture. This lack of information leads to suboptimal plant selection and can result in lower productivity and quality. By combining IoT devices and data analysis, the research intends to provide a solution that accurately predicts the most suitable coffee variety according to soil texture, enabling farmers to make informed decisions and enhance their yield potential.<br/> 
<br/>
• Uncertainty in forecasting export coffee demand and price: Fluctuating demand and unpredictable price trends in the export market pose significant challenges for coffee farmers. The absence of accurate forecasting techniques hinders effective planning and marketing strategies. The research aims to develop advanced data analysis techniques that incorporate historical data analysis and social media activity analysis to forecast export coffee demand and price trends. This solution will empower farmers with valuable insights for making informed decisions about their production and marketing strategies.<br/>
<br/>
• Disease outbreaks and lack of timely intervention: Coffee plants are susceptible to various diseases, and timely intervention is crucial to minimize crop losses. However, farmers often lack the necessary tools and knowledge to identify and diagnose diseases promptly. By leveraging image processing techniques, the research seeks to develop a system that can accurately identify and diagnose diseases in coffee plants. This solution will enable farmers to take immediate action, preventing the spread of diseases and protecting their crops.<br/>  
<br/>
• Inefficient utilization of location-specific factors and weather data: Coffee cultivation practices should be tailored to specific locations to optimize yield. However, without access to accurate data and insights, farmers struggle to make informed decisions about cultivation practices based on weather factors. The research aims to combine machine learning algorithms and weather data to predict coffee variety and yield based on location-specific factors. By analyzing historical weather patterns and real-time data from IoT devices, farmers can optimize their cultivation practices and maximize yield potential.</i></b><br/>
<br/>
<br/>Overall, the research problem lies in the limited integration of IT technology in coffee cultivation in Sri Lanka, resulting in various difficulties faced by farmers. By addressing these challenges through the proposed research solutions, which leverage IoT devices, image processing, and machine learning algorithms, the study seeks to empower coffee farmers with accurate information and actionable insights. This will enable them to make informed decisions, enhance productivity, improve quality, and compete effectively in the global coffee market.<br/>
